Flow for the algorithm for S_3(5):

1.	Take one vertex from the central clique. This is arbitrary.
		-In our case, 221 is fine.
2.	Designate this vertex the "origin."
3.	If the origin is not in our independent set, add it to the set.
4.	Eliminate the adjacent vertices.
		- At this point, there are six:
			- 212, 122, the rest of the clique.
			- 131, 311, the 2 vertices from (3,1,1) adjacent to 221
			- 230, 320, the 2 vertices from (3,2,0) adjacent to 221
5.	If there are vertices two degrees removed from the origin, continue to step 5.
	Else, go to step 7.
6.	If there is only one eligible vertex, move to it.
	Else move to a vertex adjacent to two of the vertices eliminated in step 3 (does not matter which one).
	Go to step 2.
7.	If the current vertex is the first in our set list, terminate.
	Else, move to the immediately previous vertex in our set list and go to step 2.
